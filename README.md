I took on this projet as I spend a lot of time perusing goodreads... but importantly I wanted to practice using a public API (https://www.goodreads.com/api).

All the work done extracting the relevant data from the API is done on the frontend.

A few keys things that were needed in order to make this project work:

Accesing two APIs. The first API requires the author name which is typed in by the user. The second API requires the Author ID which is found in the first API. All of the data rendered on is from the second the API.

Conversion of data from xml to json.

Strong knowledge of loops. Obtaining relevant datarequires looping through goodreads api and pushing relevant data into an array.

As with previous projects, I was required to have a strong understanding of React hooks including: useState, useEffect, useContext, useForm.

Again, I was required to have strong knowledge of the component tree and the way in which 'props' flow down to children and granchildren etc.
